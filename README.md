#Introduction

This project is focused on testing the performance of two popular boosting models - AdaBoostRegressor and GradientBoostingRegressor - on the Tata Steel data set. The project included several steps, including exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model building and evaluation.

Data Set

The data set used for this project is the Tata Steel data set, which contains daily stock prices from 1996 to 2023. The features in the data set include Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Adj Close, and Volume.

Exploratory Data Analysis

The first step in the project was to conduct EDA on the data set to understand the trends and patterns. The analysis revealed that the stock prices followed a cyclical pattern and had a high degree of volatility. Visualizations were created to illustrate these trends and patterns.

Feature Engineering

Feature engineering was then performed to create new features that could improve the performance of the models. The new features included moving averages, exponential moving averages, and percentage change in stock prices.

Model Building and Evaluation

The next step in the project was to build and evaluate the performance of two boosting models - AdaBoostRegressor and GradientBoostingRegressor. Both models were trained on the data set and their performance was evaluated using mean squared error (MSE) and R-squared metrics. The models were also evaluated using visualizations of predicted versus actual values.

Conclusion

In conclusion, this project demonstrated the effectiveness of using boosting models for predicting stock prices. The AdaBoostRegressor and GradientBoostingRegressor models performed well, with GradientBoostingRegressor achieving a slightly better performance. The project also showed the importance of EDA and feature engineering in improving the performance of the models. The code and visualizations for this project have been shared on GitHub, allowing others to replicate and build on this work.
